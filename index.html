<div class="storyContent">
    Once upon a time in a magical land, there was a castle. In its dark depths, a quiet meeting took place.
An unarmed soldier knelt on the ground before a woman.
The woman's name was Aurelia, and she wore a beautiful dress with the royal seal on the front.
Against the dress, she was plain by comparison.
"Do you pledge me your love?" she asked him as a bead of sweat travelled down her face.
He hesitated and gave an uneasy nod. "I love you, my Queen."
Aurelia's hands trembled ever so slightly, and her eyes darted around the room. "Then rise, my love," her voice quivered, "and fight for me."
The soldier was then ushered into an attached room, and there he joined a group of unarmed soldiers like him.
An old man came in and whispered secretly to the guards, "She doesn't inspire the troops. We will use her sister instead."
He rubbed his hands together. "Her sister is a little young for a Queen, but the men will really fall for her."
"This way," he announced deviously. "A feast awaits! To celebrate your graduation into the Queen's Army!"
The men were led away, and when their screams rang out, Aurelia sprang to her feet.
</div>
<div class="storyContent">Far away from the castle in a valley, a rugged man named Titus was outnumbered by ogres.
    His eyes were alight with fury. After a bloody battle, he was victorious.
    When he returned to the lively fort he called home, his wife, Iris, tackled him at the door. "What have you brought home?" she laughed.
    He noticed a lovely scent he had never smelled before, and she was looking a lot more painted up than usual. She was stunning.
    He squeezed his way around her and dumped a heavy sack of gold on the desk.
    She ran over and quickly swept some stray letters off the top of the desk.
    Then she looked at the gold and her eyes gleamed. "Wow! How much <div id='emFont'>is</div> that?"
    Titus made a sad face and dug out a deck of cards from the desk. "I was hoping we could play a few games first?" he asked.
    Iris rolled her sparkly eyes, "After we go shopping!" She pushed him playfully. "After that we will play your little game."
    Together, they shopped for hours and returned home only when the sun went down.
    Before Titus knew it, Iris crashed on the bed and was fast asleep.
    Titus sat on the bed and stroked her cheek. "Goodnight, darling."</div>
<div class="storyContent">Back in the depths of the castle, more fresh soldiers were taken down into the darkness.
    There was a woman in a stunning dress, but this time she had a young, pretty face.
    "Do you pledge me your love?" she asked the man bowing before her.
    He looked up into her eyes. "I love you, my Queen."
    "Then rise," she continued, "and fight for me."
    The soldier was escorted away, and another was marched in.
    The halls of the castle were very quiet that night.
    Meanwhile, Aurelia snuck around the castle in the clothes of a commoner.
    She had a backpack with some supplies and a hood that covered her plain face.
    Though she did not move with grace, she finally made it out beyond the sentries and into the night.
    She took one final glance at the castle with her wet eyes before turning away.</div>
<div class="storyContent">The next week at the fort, Titus found himself unable to pay for a meal.
    "I guess we'll have to eat at home," Titus rubbed the back of his neck with a grin.
    "Who is <div id='emFont'>we</div>?" Iris crossed her arms. "You have to go out and hunt bounties again."
    Titus nodded. "I guess I can hunt some goblins by the edge of  the forest."
    "No, no," she flung her arms up. "Such small foes are worthless!"
    Titus went home and sharpened his sword. Then he began to fiddle idly with his playing cards.
    "Just go already!" Iris exclaimed, "or today will be over!"
    Without another word, Titus grabbed his sword, packed his things and left. 
    A couple days later, Titus was closing in on the trail of some ogres. 
    He found them gathered by a mysterious remote tower.
    His eyes were narrowed, and his muscles were tight as he watched them.
    Then he pounced on them, and their battle ended with him frantically charging into the last enemy.
    They crashed into a table that Titus hadn't noticed at all, and glass smashed all around them.
    "Imbecile!" a coarse voice yelled, and an old man ran up to him.
    "I'm sorry!" Titus cried, but it was too late, as the old man began waving his wand in the air.
    Magic swirled around Titus' ankles and wrists, and a strange inscription was woven into his skin like ink.
    "You are a brute!" the old man accused. "But now your days of violence are over."</div>
<div class="storyContent">In wild far-off lands, Aurelia was having her own hard journey.
    When other travellers passed her by, she puffed up her hood and concealed her face.
    Eventually night fell, and she stopped at a busy tavern in a little town in the middle of nowhere.
    She had lots of money, so she ordered a meal and began to eat.
    She looked down at her bland oatmeal and frowned.
    After her meal, she got up and someone bumped into her. 
    Her hood fell back, revealing her identity, but no one seemed to mind.
    People drank their ale and sang their songs. A group of men harrassed a pretty lady in the corner.
    Despite seeing such a boisterous scene, she decided it was safe for her to stay the night.</div>
<div class="storyContent">Titus returned home with his head low and rubbing his wrists.
    When he opened the door, Iris was rummaging around the desk and was very startled at his entrance.
    She tucked something away and regained her composure.
    She ran over and clutched him at the door. "What have you brought home this time?" She giggled warmly.
    Titus held up a little bag of gold â€“ a hefty sum from the ogres he defeated at the tower.
    He threw the gold on the bed and began towards the desk to fetch his cards. "What is that?" his wife interupted, and she seized his arms.
    He explained what happened, and she shook her head feverishly. "An empty threat from a washed-up sorcerer. He merely splashed you with ink."
    She picked up the gold pouch from their bed and began out the door. "If that was true, then I'd be able to beat you up."
    Titus followed Iris outside and admired her from behind as flower petals floated down on her glamorous figure.
    The two spent the rest of daylight together in the marketplace, and when the sun went down, so did she.</div>
<div class="storyContent">Aurelia woke up the next morning to a loud noise. She reached for the blade she had stashed under her pillow.
    After an uneventful standoff with nothing, her palm hurt from the leather handle. She packed up her knife and cautiously left the tavern in peace.
    She set out on the road again, travelling even further away from her forsaken kingdom.
    After a while, she came to a vibrant town with throngs of people having fun.
    There were performances here, crafts there, and a fascinating aroma filled her nose.
    Even though she just wanted to pass through quietly, one act really stopped Aurelia in her tracks.
    There was a fetching man and woman dancing on a stage, with a crowd below, cheering for them.
    Aurelia eyed the heavenly woman in all her grace and watched as her silky skin shone in the light.
    "She is so lovely," she heard someone say, and she felt herself nod involuntarily.
    Soon after that, Aurelia left the town. Her pace was a little slower for the rest of the day.</div>
<div class="storyContent">Titus and his wife were having a marvelous time in the marketplace, and they had lunch with some of her friends.
    Later, Titus found a store with playing cards and was delighted, but the day grew late. He thought he should find his wife and go home.
    On their way back, it was quiet, and some thuggish men approached them in the darkness. 
    "We always see you two shopping," said one with a toothless grin. "And youse don't eat the same grub we eat, if ya catch me drift."
    A different bandit motioned toward the gold pouch with his knife. "You dropped it on yer way home, ya hear?"
    Titus dropped the gold pouch without delay, and Iris shrieked. "We can't let them have a single coin! We earned those!"
    When a bandit reached for the gold, Iris lashed out and copped a backhand for her trouble.
    Now Titus was enraged. He threw a fist at one thug, but recoiled quickly as the magic burned hot against his skin.
    "Titus!" she wailed, "Are you serious?!"
    The beatdown was over quickly, as the robbers took what they wanted and left the scene.</div>
<div class="storyContent">Aurelia roamed on through the countryside, the sun beaming hot against her skin.
    Her throat was parched, and she was just barely able to find a lake.
    She dunked her bottle in the water. When the lake's surface settled again, she saw her face glaring back up at her.
    She shattered the image with another dunk of the bottle.
    Then she noticed some chalky-looking rocks by her leg.
    She smeared the colors on her face and looked again into the lake's waters.
    She scowled and spashed her face desperately with water.
    The colors faded, and she was plain once again.</div>
<div class="storyContent"">The bed was messy, and there was junk scattered all over the place. Titus sat on the floor against the wall as his wife paced.
    "The magic is real," she breathed, "and now you will have to get a new job."
    Titus nodded and went out around the marketplace in search of a new job.
    After quite a few rejections, his eyes happened upon a certain little store from before. It was the card store.
    "A little break can't hurt," he told himself. Before he knew it, he was perusing rare card designs and the like.
    The store owner noticed the passion in Titus' eyes and offered him a part-time job. Titus took it without hestitation.
    He rushed home to tell his wife the good news, and his eyes were beaming with enthusiasm.
    When he told her, she queried him on the specifics and was taken aback by the numbers. "Our entire lifestyle will have to change!" she growled.
    His wife yelled at him, and for the first time ever, he yelled back.
    "How dare you yell at me!" she howled and began pounding on his chest. "How dare you settle for that job!" She punched and kicked, and after a while, Titus finally lay still.
    She stormed off outside. He loathed her from the ground as cards floated down upon his beaten figure.</div>
<div class="storyContent"">Aurelia sighed with relief as she reached her final destination. It was a little cottage tucked away in some trees by a lake.
    She kept her eyes straight as she walked past the lake and headed straight for the cottage.
    When she got inside, she unpacked some of her belongings and stopped on one particular item.
    It was a beautiful dress with the royal seal on the front. She held it and closed her eyes tight.
    A tear ran down her cheek, and she let it fall to the floor. Then she kicked it under the bed.
    Aurelia toured the cottage in silence. There was a fireplace with no wood and a broken table. A section of the ceiling appeared to leak against the wall. 
    She sighed and sat down gracefully on the dusty couch. 
    She looked down at her own soft hands and shook her head slightly.</div>
<div class="storyContent"">With a great sword on his back and some cards in his pocket, Titus limped out into the forest alone.
    He hobbled through his familiar hunting grounds and into the unknown beyond.
    Night fell and his stomach rumbled. So, he built a fire and began to search for dinner.
    His eyes widened, as he happened across a big meaty boar that was stuck between some rocks. 
    When he prepared to strike the animal down, he found that the runes burned like magma, and he could not move at all.
    With a big grunt, the boar broke free and fled the scene.
    Titus groaned in anguish and fell to his knees.
    After his moment of weakness was over, he raised his head and saw a bush full of colorful berries. "Not quite what I'm used to," he surrendered, "but it'll do."</div>
<div class="storyContent"">As days went by, Aurelia's skin got tougher, and her limbs became slightly toned.
    She carried heavy buckets of water from the lake up to the house.
    She hunted the beasts of the wild, gutted them and cooked them.
    She chopped firewood and stockpiled it for the coming winter.
    She even made some repairs to parts of the house that had fallen prey to years of abandonment.
    One day, she was chopping firewood and talking idly to herself, when she spotted something through the trees.
    Her heart was full of dread, and she took careful steps closer to see what it was.
    She tightened the grip on her axe and braced herself for the worst.</div>
<div class="storyContent"">Titus continued his journey into a brand new world.
    His ankles bled badly, and he rubbed a coarse rock vigorously on his wrists. The runes glowed like embers through the blood.
    After a while of that, he pocketed the stone and began swinging his sword through the air as he walked. He mumbled incoherently to himself as he sliced through the wind.
    Eventually, he happened upon an ogre in the middle of nowhere. He had not been seen.
    Titus charged into battle, and though he struggled his best, he could not strike the beast. When the ogre realized this, Titus became its toy.
    Aurelia ended the monster's game early, as she sliced the giant to death with some well-aimed strikes of her axe.
    Titus made eye contact with his saviour one time, before keeping his eyes fixed low on the dirt.
    Aurelia stole a few glances of the bloodied and handsome man before her, but was glad when he didn't look back.</div>
<div class="storyContent"">Even though it was awkward, Aurelia insisted that Titus stay with her while she tend to his injuries.
    As time went on, Titus' wounds began to close, and he started to move around more.
    Titus slept in the living room, and they played cards together everyday.
    While they played together, they talked and shared their lives. "I was once a princess," she told him. "I was once a man," he replied.
    One night, Titus had a nightmare where he saw himself striking his ex-wife.
    When he awoke, his magic runes burned hot in his skin, and his fists were balled tightly.
    Aurelia ran to the living room to comfort him. "She's not worth it," she said and held his hand.</div>
<div class="storyContent"">There was a deer wandering through the forest, and then it spotted some food.
    A few curious steps and a loud thump later, the beast was trapped in a deep hole.
    Titus threw up his hands from his hiding spot. "I caught dinner!" he celebrated.
    Aurelia smirked beside him, "But I suppose I will need to kill it and skin it?"
    Titus smiled anyway, "I still haven't figured that part out yet. So, you'll have to do it this time."
    Later, Aurelia cooked dinner, and Titus was in a better mood than ever.</div>
<div class="storyContent"">One day, Titus was cleaning and found a beautiful dress underneath Aurelia's bed.
    He rushed to her with it, "You would look amazing in this!" He held it up against her.
    Suddenly, she cried and ran outside to the lake. Titus dropped the dress and ran after her.
    He caught up and found her looking sadly at her reflection in the water.
    Titus sighed. "You're beautiful, you know," he told her gently. "You're my princess."
    Aurelia wiped away her tears and smiled at him, "And you're my man."
    They shared a passionate kiss by the lake, and Aurelia's face lit up with such wonderful colors.</div>
